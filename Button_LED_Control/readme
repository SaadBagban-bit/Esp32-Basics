# Button Controlled LED (ESP32)

This project demonstrates how to control an LED using a push-button with an ESP32 microcontroller. When the button is pressed, the LED turns ON. When the button is released, the LED turns OFF.

## Circuit Details

- **LED** connected to GPIO2.
- **Push-button** connected to GPIO4.
- A pull-down resistor is used with the button to ensure proper logic level detection.

## Components Used

- ESP32 Dev Board
- LED (any color)
- 220Ω resistor (for LED)
- Push-button
- 10kΩ resistor (pull-down)
- Breadboard & jumper wires

## Code Highlights

- `pinMode()` is used to set the LED as output and button as input.
- `digitalRead()` checks button state.
- `digitalWrite()` sets the LED accordingly.

## Outcome

When the button is pressed, the LED lights up. This is a basic example of reading digital input and controlling output using ESP32 and Embedded C.
