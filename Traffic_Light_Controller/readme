# Traffic Light Controller using ESP32

This project simulates a basic traffic light system using an ESP32 and three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green). The logic follows a standard traffic signal cycle with appropriate timing delays.

## ðŸš¦ Behavior

- **Red Light ON** â†’ 5 seconds  
- **Yellow Light ON** â†’ 2 seconds  
- **Green Light ON** â†’ 5 seconds  
- Repeats in a loop

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Used

- ESP32 Dev Module  
- 3 x LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)  
- 3 x 220Î© Resistors  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  
- Micro USB cable

## ðŸ“Œ Wiring Diagram

| LED Color | GPIO Pin | Resistor | Notes        |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Red       | GPIO 2   | 220Î©     | Connect to GND via resistor |
| Yellow    | GPIO 4   | 220Î©     | Connect to GND via resistor |
| Green     | GPIO 5   | 220Î©     | Connect to GND via resistor |

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- GPIO handling on ESP32  
- Traffic signal logic using timing (`delay`)  
- Clean use of macros (`#define`) for pin mapping  
- How to simulate real-world systems using microcontrollers

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Connect LEDs as per the wiring above  
2. Flash the code using Arduino IDE  
3. LEDs will simulate the traffic light logic in a loop
