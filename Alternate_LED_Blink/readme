# Alternate LED Blink on ESP32

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to blink two LEDs alternately using GPIO pins. It's a simple beginner-level project to learn pin control using Embedded C with the Arduino framework.

## 📌 Components Used
- ESP32 board
- 2 LEDs
- 2 x 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## ⚙️ Pin Configuration
- LED1 → GPIO 2  
- LED2 → GPIO 4  

## 💡 Working
The code alternates between turning LED1 ON and LED2 OFF, and then LED1 OFF and LED2 ON every 1 second using the `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` functions.

## 🧠 Skills Learned
- Basic digital I/O control
- Writing and uploading code to ESP32
- Using GPIO pins effectively
- Version control with GitHub

## 🚀 Getting Started
Upload the code in `alternate_led_blink.ino` to your ESP32 using Arduino IDE.
