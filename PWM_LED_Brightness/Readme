A simple project to control LED brightness using PWM on ESP32.

Hardware
ESP32 board
LED + 220Î© resistor

Circuit
LED connected to GPIO pin (through resistor) and GND

How it Works
PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is used to vary LED brightness.
The duty cycle of the PWM signal controls how bright or dim the LED appears.
LED smoothly fades in and out.
